This is a test blog that I'm creating while learning ReactJS. It's a cool framework which I'm learning as we speak. I think it's important in any situation when learning how to do something to have the proper documentation as backup:

1. I went to lynda.com and watched the video:
   Up and Running with React.js" http://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/Welcome/379264/475798-4.html to learn the basics of ReactJS
2. I downloaded the following Google Chrome extensions:
   a)react developer tools and
   b)react detector
3. I found this site https://github.com/vesparny/morpheus
which is a blog creator for ReactJS(one of the fun open source ones)
4. I followed steps 5-7 below and here's what happened:
5. Followed the instructions but ran into an admin error on the system so had to change the following command 'gulp install' to 'sudo npm install --global gulp' which over-rode the error I received and enabled gulp to be installed correctly
6. Ran the start server command 'gulp watch'(but received a compatibility error)
so I re-ran 'gulp install' which worked and enabled my app to get up an running.
7. Kept having an issue getting the blog link working to view this page and realized that i had to create a file in content/posts/yyyy-mm-dd 120055-lars-berg-second-post.md the link wouldn't work until I added that strange number 120055 dash lars-etc etc. Anyway it's working now but there's still a glitch when you refresh this page.
